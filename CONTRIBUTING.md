# Contributing to Simplejobscript - free job board software

We encourage, appreciate and are very thankful for any help and contributions to the project. If you fixed any bug, developed a feature and would like to give back to the community and help all the future users you can submit a pull request or [contact us](https://simplejobscript.com/contact/) to discuss any details. At the moment we are aware the front-end design section of the job board (mainly CSS) needs code refactoring as multiple developers worked on it there are duplications that await a simplification.
